# Hacker Rank Problems

Greetings! I wanted to create some jupyter notebooks to share some of my HackerRank solutions. My primary objective with these notebooks is to show my thought process behind each problem, provide takeaways from each problem, and what I would do differently. 

Currenty, I am solving python and SQL problems that are seperated in two folders. 

## Format
Each HackerRank solution is in a seperate jupyter notebook. Also, each notebook contains a link to the original problem statement from HackerRank.
